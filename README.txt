This project started with the tutorial provided by JimShapedCoding at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0), which assisted in creating the 'collect_jobs()' method of 'Web_Scrape_Timejobs.py'. 

	At this time: 

		This project looks at the website, timesjobs.com and does the following: 

			1.Search for all job opportunities at timejobs.com with the following filters: 
				-Job post date
				-Required Skills for position
			2.Retrieve information on each job
			3.Begin prettifying data for use in sqlite3 database "jobs.db"


	Future goals include: 
		1.continue prettifying data for sqlite3. 
		2.update sqlite3 with all data for all jobs matching user criteria
		3.automate app to perform once every 3 days. 
		4.'Modulize" this code as part of larger effort to analyze data. 
			-charts, graphs, comparisons, etc.
